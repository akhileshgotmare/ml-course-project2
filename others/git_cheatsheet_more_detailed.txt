# CLONING THE REPO

# First we start with cloning the repository
$ git clone <repo_url>

# We need to move to the directory containing ".git" directory (it is a hidden file on unix-like systems); in our case it would be PCML_Project_2
$ cd PCML_Project_2



# WORKING WITH GIT

# To see the state-of-art on our local copy
$ git status

# To prepare files to commit
$ git add --all

# To commit the changes (you may add some labels like [ADD] or [UPDATE] in the beginning of the message
$ git commit -m "<comment/message>"

# (safe way) To update the local master branch with the remote (server) one
$ git fetch
# If no conflicts you can omit the previous command and download the changes
$ git pull origin master

# To upload the changes done to your local master branch into server
$ git push origin master

# Remember strategy: add => commit => pull => push

# Sometimes you may want to drop your changes instead of commiting them (it will also delete untracked files - the files that weren't added)
$ git stash -u

# You may also want to revert the changes done to one particular file
$ git checkout -- <name_of_the_file>



# WORKING ON BRANCHES

# To create a new branch and switch to it
$ git checkout -b <name_of_new_branch>

# To switch to another branch (possible only if you commited your changes)
$ git checkout <name_of_existing_branch>

# To upload the branch to server (details: http://stackoverflow.com/a/1519032)
git push origin <name_of_local_branch>

# To fetch/pull all the changes from all the branches (reference: http://stackoverflow.com/a/10312587)
$ git fetch --all
(only once) $ git branch -r | grep -v '\->' | while read remote; do git branch --track "${remote#origin/}" "$remote"; done
$ git pull --all

# To merge your branch with master (more info: http://stackoverflow.com/a/5602109)
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git merge <name_of_your_branch>
git push origin master


# To delete the branch both remotely and locally where <name_of_the_remote_branch> according to the previous commands should be equal to <name_of_the_local_branch>
$ git push origin --delete <name_of_the_remote_branch>
$ git branch -d <name_of_the_local_branch>
