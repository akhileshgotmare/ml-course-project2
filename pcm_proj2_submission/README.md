PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Project 2 of the course CS 433 Machine Learning taught at EPFL. The task is to build a recommender system to predict ratings when ratings for some user-item pairs are given. The approach chosen is using collaborative filtering via matrix factorisation. We make use of two different optimisation algorithms to obtain the factorisation - Alternating Least Squares (ALS) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Our final prediction is based on the ALS approach, hence in order to evaluate the final predictions (using run.py files) go to the ALS directory's readme file.
 

##Structure of the directory

ALS directory: Contains ipython notebook, run.py files and other related library files built and used in the ALS approach
SGD directory: Contains ipython notebook and helper files containing work done with the SGD approach
Project_Report.pdf: The project report of work by our team 'ALS is the best'

###External libraries
	We use numpy and scipy. For plotting we use matplotlib.
